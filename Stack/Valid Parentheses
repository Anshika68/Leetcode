Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        hashmap = {']':'[', '}':'{', ')':'('}
        for element in s:
            if stack and (element in hashmap and stack[-1] == hashmap[element]):
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(element)
        
        return not stack
